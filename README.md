# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning
 This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting brain tumors using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and the EfficientNet-B0 model. The project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model to classify brain tumor images into categories such as "No Tumor" or 'Type of Tumor". The model is trained on a publicly available dataset on Kaggle, which can be accessed via the link below. The notebook includes all necessary steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It also showcases the performance of EfficientNet-B0, a lightweight and efficient architecture, to compare the model's performance. To run the notebook, ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.
